# Project KotOT

## Prototype Player Controller
The aim of this project is to assess the viability of this experimental player controller,
and whether it provides an additional layer to how immersive the game is. There also exists
the possibility that it may add too much complexity, and detracts from the play style. By
creating this small, simplistic prototype, we hope to gain feedback and decide whether this
is a suitable method for player control going forward.
